# delightful-ux-training-app
App for training https://github.com/callstack-internal/training-delightful-ux-with-react-native

## Plan  
The app will be a player. Features:  
* Collapsible header with artist name and logo (maybe some additional info - artistInfo.json), collapses to artist name only   
* Flatlist with songs (topTracks.json)
  * Swipe to remove (Swipeable row from gesture handler)
  * Tap to play (Show player similar to RN Paper Banner https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/banner.html)
* On dummy player buttons play, pause and stop with animated bar (no songs, bar only) 
* Internalized strings
* Accessible components
